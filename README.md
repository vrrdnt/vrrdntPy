# vrrdntPy (rewrite branch)  

Hey there! This is a script I authored that I use to render videos and upload them to [vrrdnt](https://youtube.com/vrrdnt). I wrote it over the span of about a week. It's my first self-authored script. I do know, however, that it could use some massive improvement. If you feel like contributing it please don't hesitate to make a pull request.

## Requirements

Please run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  
NOTE: This is subject to change. Both youtubeuploader and nexrender can in some way be integrated natively into this project, depending on what you use After Effects for. This script will change as I change the nature of my videos as well as my workflow.

## TODO

Normalize audio.mp3 to 93.5 dB (using pyDub?)
