# vrrdntPy

Hey there! This is a script I authored that I use to render videos and upload them to [vrrdnt](https://youtube.com/vrrdnt). I wrote it over the span of about a week. It's my first self-authored script, and I'm pretty proud of it. I do know, however, that it could use some massive improvement. If you feel like improving it please don't hesitate to make a pull request.


## Requirements

-- insert pip requirements

## Files and folders

You'll need a working Adobe After Effects project file, either named Video.aep or something else that you specify in render.js.
